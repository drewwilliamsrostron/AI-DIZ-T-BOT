"""Light-weight training-state loader/saver.

Features
--------
* Always initialises ``G.global_best_composite_reward`` to -âˆž when the value is
  missing from a checkpoint, so comparisons in ``ensemble.train_one_epoch`` can
  never raise a ``TypeError``.
* Optional `save()` helper for symmetry with `load()`.
